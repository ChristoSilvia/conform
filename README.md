## Conform - Adaptive Conformal Mappings between Arbitrary Domains

Conform is a package for computing adaptive conformal mappings between arbitrary user-specified polygons.  The main focus is to make an implementation of the Riemann Mapping Theorem.

The package builds an executable which does not have a well-defined purpose, but I am using for testing.

The conformal mapping package can also be used to build videos of hyperbolic spaces.

I will add some example problems in the future.
